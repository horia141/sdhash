# SDHash

A Python library useful for computing hashes of images which ignore perceptual differences.

## Usage

## Background

Suppose you want to test that two images are identical. The naive approach of simply comparing the byte-array representation of the two is not good.

## Algorithm

## Dependencies

The Python image library and NumPy/SciPy etc.

## TODO

Resistance to rotation, mirroring etc.
Tunable knobs (for similarity detection etc.)
